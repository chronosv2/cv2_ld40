This was my project for Ludum Dare 40, themed "The more you have, the worse it is."

The game was made in Unity 2017.2 using Aseprite for graphics, Bfxr for sound effects and Bosca Ceoil for music.

This is the compo version of the project, with a tiny bugfix lowering some blasting sound effects' volume.
