# cv2_ld40: Factory Panic
This was my project for Ludum Dare 40, themed "The more you have, the worse it is."

The game was made in Unity 2017.2 using Aseprite for graphics, Bfxr for sound effects and Bosca Ceoil for music.

This is the compo version of the project, with a tiny bugfix lowering some blasting sound effects' volume.

### Note that there will be no further updates to this repository. Future updates to this project are closed-source. Feel free to learn from this project but know that I have plans for it.
